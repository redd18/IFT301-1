    <strong>Me When I'm Focused</strong>


    <strong>Interesting Stuff About Me</strong>

    <p>Well, you already know my name, but my name is Nicholas. I'm a software developer at the United States
        Geological Survey located in Flagstaff Arizona. I've been working there for about 2 years now and I found out
        about ASU online through the most unlikely of places. It happens to be an advertisement from Facebook. But
        given how many people like the advertisement or at least react to it I would imagine that it's making a
        significant impact. But less about that, more about my history. I'm from the Philippines; I was adopted when
        I was 2. I spent most of my time in California and then graduated from high school and moved to Flagstaff. I
        spent about 5 years at NAU. Eventually, I came to the realization that their program was just not for me and
        I decided to find something a little bit more my speed. Thus why I'm here. Right now I'm majoring in
        Information Technology.
    </p>

    <p>I knew I wanted to get into this field around the age of 14. And why is 14 so significant to me? It was at
        this age that I had designed a fully-functional artificial intelligent chat robot, and from that point on it
        was all just downhill. I started diving into far more complex things and began involving myself more in
        technology and computers.
    </p>

    <strong>Personal interests</strong>

    <p>
        I have a varying array of personal interest. However, the interest that I focus on mostly is of course robotics
        and computers. I also absolutely love racquetball. It's a fun sport and quite energizing. I also love going out
        and experiencing nature. It's calm and I never have to think too much when traversing it. Interestingly I also
        have a strong fascination with photography and film. I can get my artsy-fartsy out. This coupled with hiking
        through nature can yield some nice results.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've made it this far, thank you for reading a little about me.
    </p>
    <p>
        ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
