            <strong>Interesting Stuff About Me</strong>

            <p>Well, you already know my name, but my name is Nicholas. I'm a software developer at the United States
                Geological Survey located in Flagstaff Arizona. I've been working there for about 2 years now and I
                found out about ASU online through the most unlikely of places. It happens to be an advertisement from
                Facebook.
                But given how many people like the advertisement or at least react to it I would imagine that it's
                making a
                significant impact. But less about that, more about my history. I'm from the Philippines; I was adopted
                when I was 2. I spent most of my time in California and then graduated from high school and moved to
                Flagstaff. I spent about 5 years at NAU. Eventually, I came to the realization that their program was
                just not for me
                and I decided to find something a little bit more my speed. Thus why I'm here. Right now I'm majoring in
                Information Technology.
            </p>

            <p>I knew I wanted to get into this field around the age of 14. And why is 14 so significant to me? It was
                at
                this age that I had designed a fully-functional artificial intelligent chat robot, and from that point
                on it
                was all just downhill. I started diving into far more complex things and began involving myself more in
                technology and computers.

            <strong>Personal interests</strong>

            <p>
                I have a varying array of personal interest. However, the interest that I focus on mostly is of course
                robotics
                and computers. I also absolutely love racquetball. It's a fun sport and quite energizing. I also love
                going out
                and experiencing nature. It's calm and I never have to think too much when traversing it. Interestingly
                I also
                have a strong fascination with photography and film. I can get my artsy-fartsy out. This coupled with
                hiking
                through nature can yield some nice results.
            </p>

                If you've made it this far, thank you for reading a little about me.
