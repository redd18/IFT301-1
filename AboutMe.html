    <p>Welcome to the <strong>"About Me"</strong> section of my Website</p>


    <dl>
        <dt>Hello, my name is Nicholas.</dt>
        <dd>I'm a Software Engineer. If you weren't able to discern that from the code above. Let me talk a little
            about who I am, and why I'm here.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <strong>List of Classes</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>IFT 372 Wireless Networking</li>
        <li>MAT 210 Brief Calculus</li>
        <li>IFT 250 Intro to UNIX Utilities</li>
        <li>IFT 301 Web Programming for HCI</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Major Background</strong>

    <p>I'll try to keep this short</p>

    <p>Well, you already know my name, but my name is Nicholas. I'm a software developer at the United States
        Geological Survey located in Flagstaff Arizona. I've been working there for about a year now and I found out
        about ASU online through the most unlikely of places. It happens to be an advertisement from Facebook. But
        given how many people like the advertisement or at least react to it I would imagine that it's making a
        significant impact. But less about that, more about my history. I'm from the Philippines; I was adopted when
        I was 2. I spent most of my time in California and then graduated from high school and moved to Flagstaff. I
        spent about 5 years at NAU. Eventually, I came to the realization that their program was just not for me and
        I decided to find something a little bit more my speed. Thus why I'm here. Right now I'm majoring in
        Information Technology.
    </p>

    <strong>Academic interests and experiences</strong>

    <p>As for my academic interests and experiences. I come from a rich background in Technology and science, so I
        tend to dive very deeply into computers and robotics. Of course, if you have any questions about these
        topics, I'd be more than happy to tell you about them. In fact, I run the NAU robotics Club here in Flagstaff. I
        spend most of my time teaching people the basics of electrical engineering and computer science.
    </p>
    <p>I knew I wanted to get into this field around the age of 14. And why is 14 so significant to me? It was at
        this age that I had designed a fully-functional artificial intelligent chat robot, and from that point on it
        was all just downhill. I started diving into far more complex things and began involving myself more in
        technology and computers.
    </p>

    <strong>Colleges and Universities attended (include Arizona State University)</strong>

    <p>I momentarily attended NAU out of a funny reason. My father, at the time, had owned land in Arizona and
        thought that he could get me a cheaper tuition rate given that fact. What we, of course, come to find out,
        is that we can't do that. But my whole family and I had fallen in love with NAU so I decided to attend
        anyways despite the fact that I couldn't get a lower tuition. However, attending this school was not all
        sunshine and roses. The school started to go through many different changes, many of them I didn't like. And
        so I had to make a decision on whether I would continue to stay or try to move on and find something that
        would fit me. Of course, I chose the latter because here I am at Arizona State University. I'm hoping that
        by taking these online classes I'll do significantly better and still be able to hold on to a part-time
        job.
    </p>

    <strong>Personal interests</strong>

    <p>
        I have a varying array of personal interest. However, the interest that I focus on mostly is of course robotics
        and computers. I also absolutely love racquetball. It's a fun sport and quite energizing. I also love going out
        and experiencing nature. It's calm and I never have to think too much when traversing it. Interestingly I also
        have a strong fascination with photography and film. I can get my artsy-fartsy out. This coupled with hiking
        through nature can yield some nice results.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've made it this far, thank you for reading a little about me. And it is clear, I failed at keeping this
        short.
