 [ ] 1. Open this HTML file: convert_numberToLetterGrade_prob.html
 [ ] 2. In the script element, add the JavaScript code for getting the user’s entry
 [ ] while the entry amount isn't 999.
      This should provide for multiple entries and conversions.
 [ ] 3. Add the JavaScript code for deriving the letter grade from the table above and
 [ ] displaying it in an alert dialog box.
 [ ] 4. If you haven’t already done so,
 [ ] add data validation to make sure the entry is a valid number from 0 through 100.
 [ ] If the entry is invalid,
      [ ] the application should just display the starting prompt dialog box.
      [ ] No need for displaying a special error message.
