<h1>Open Device Lab</h1>
<p>A recent introduction to the Polytechnic campus, the open device lab is a place for those looking for help with web
    development. Students are able to seek guidance in the creation of mobile applications, JavaScript utilities, web
    page
    design, and other coding related projects.</p>

<p>Originally founded as a Grassroots Community movement, the goal of the open device lab is to provide a facility to
    engage does working with internet connected devices, and ultimately work toward providing web applications on the
    whole.</p>
